# Higgs Machine Learning Challange with Higgs to tau tau events

## Introduction
This repository contains the code for the "multivariate analysis" of simulated data for Higgs Boson decaying in two tau leptons with three major backgrounds.

This data is obtained from [opendataCERN](https://opendata.cern.ch/record/328) where it was published for "Machine Learning Challange".

The dataset contains 818238 events.
